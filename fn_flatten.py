            Assuming following couplings:

            ModelDEC:
                source      sink
                A   out     D   in
                D   out     A   in

            aDEC:
                source      sink
                A   in      B   in1
                A   in      C   in
                C   out     B   in2
                B   out     A   out

            dDEC:
                source      sink
                D   in      E   in
                E   out     D   out

        The FPES would look like:

                Model-XY
                    |
                ModelDEC
                    |
            -----------------
            |       |       |
            B       C       E

            with the couplings in ModelDEC:
                source      sink
                E   out     B   in1
                C   out     B   in2
                E   out     C   in
                B   out     E   in

        The idea is:
        1) get a list with all couplings of the PES
        2) go through the list and if one part of a coupling like " A out " refers to an inner node, try to replace all occurences of " A out " with another coupling containing " A out "
            (if a node is an inner node, the name is not in the nodenamesPartOfFpes list) -> see the example for details

        For the example above:
        source      sink
        A   out     D   in
        D   out     A   in
        A   in      B   in1
        A   in      C   in
        C   out     B   in2
        B   out     A   out
        D   in      E   in
        E   out     D   out
                |
        Take the first coupling, " A out " is identified as inner coupling (on the source side) -> try to replace all occurrences of " A out "
        Found in the 6th coupling, replace with " B out " -> Keep in mind, that a source should stay a source and a sink should stay a sink,
        so the replacement for " A out " should be found on the source side (and " A out " in the replacement coupling pair is then on the sink side like in the 6th coupling).
        Remove the used 6th couplings from the list.
                |
        source      sink
        B   out     D   in
        D   out     A   in
        A   in      B   in1
        A   in      C   in
        C   out     B   in2
        D   in      E   in
        E   out     D   out
                |
        The node D will not be in the FPES, so " D in " and " D out " are inner couplings, which need to be replaced.
        " D in " can be replaced with the 6th coupling. Remove the used 6th coupling.
                |
        source      sink
        B   out     E   in
        D   out     A   in
        A   in      B   in1
        A   in      C   in
        C   out     B   in2
        E   out     D   out
                |
        " D out " can be replaced with the 6th coupling. Remove the 6th coupling.
                |
        source      sink
        B   out     E   in
        E   out     A   in
        A   in      B   in1
        A   in      C   in
        C   out     B   in2
                |
        " A in " will not be in the FPES, but it is twice in the third and fourth coupling -> therefore " A in " is replaced by " E out " and the 2nd coupling is deleted.
                |
        source      sink
        B   out     E   in
        E   out     B   in1
        E   out     C   in
        C   out     B   in2
                |
        The correct couplings are evaluated for the FPES.

        The following algorithm works like that, only all sourcenodes are travelled first, afterwards all sinknodes are travelled. The couplinglist is split into source- and sinkcouplings therefore.
